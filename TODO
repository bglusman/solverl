 Add :skip to solve_sync

 Add functions to access solution data rather than through res[:solutions]

 Examples: Add graph coloring.

 More events/timestamps (compile time, time since last solution etc.)
 Add model and data files to the solver state.
 More test cases (data conversions).
 Parameter for limiting number of solutions (?)
 Erlang interface

 Branch-and-bound example.
 LNS example.

+ Make results of solve_sync into a map of :solutions, :summary, :minizinc_error
+ Rethink :stop behaviour; better residual msg cleanup after :stop.
+ Merge solution-related fields into a record
+ Parse key-values into {atom(), native_type()}
+ Handle minizinc start errors (such as improper model / missed data)

+	Synchronous solve (?)

+ Review for private functions.
